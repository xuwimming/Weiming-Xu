												    <h3>Foldable low-cost point-of-care device for testing blood coagulation using smartphones</h3>
												    <p> Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) caused by thrombotic events are a significant global health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. The international normalized ratio (INR) is the most widely used measure of coagulation status, and frequent testing is required to adjust blood-thinning drug dosage, requiring hospital visits and experts to perform the test. Here we present a low-cost and portable smartphone-based device for screening INR levels from whole blood samples at the point of care. Our device uses a 3D printed platform and light-emitting diode backlight modules to create a uniform optical environment, and its foldable design allows for easy transport. Our device also features an algorithm that allows users to acquire and process video of sample flow in a microfluidic channel on their smartphone, providing a cost-effective and convenient option for blood coagulation monitoring at the point of care. We tested the performance of our smartphone-based INR device using both commercially available control samples and clinical human blood samples, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability. Our device has the potential to improve patient outcomes by enabling more frequent monitoring and, as appropriate, dosage adjustments of blood-thinning drugs, providing an affordable and portable option for screening INR levels at the point of care. </p>

											    	<h3>An integrated wearable fluorescence sensor for <em>E. coli</em> detection in catheter bags</h3>
											    	<p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs), including catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs), affect millions worldwide. Traditional diagnostic methods, like urinalysis and urine culture, have limitations—urinalysis is fast but lacks sensitivity, while urine culture is accurate but takes up to two days. Here, we present an integrated wearable fluorescence sensor to detect UTI-related bacterial infections early at the point of care by on-body monitoring. The sensor features a hardware platform with a flexible PCB that attaches to a urine catheter bag, emitting excitation light and detecting emission light of <em>E. coli</em>-specific enzymatic reaction for continuous monitoring. Our custom-developed smartphone application allows remote control and data transfer via Bluetooth and performs in situ data analysis without cloud computing. The performance of the device was demonstrated by detecting <em>E. coli</em> at concentrations of 100–105 CFU/mL within 9 to 3.5 h, respectively, with high sensitivity and by testing the specificity using Gram-positive (i.e., <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>) and Gram-negative (i.e., <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>) pathogens. An in vitro bladder model testing was performed using <em>E. coli</em>-spiked human urine samples to further evaluate the device's practicality. This portable, cost-effective device has the potential to transform the clinical practice of UTI diagnosis with automated and rapid bacterial detection at the point of care.</p>

												    <h3>OpenLM: an open-source pixel super-resolution platform for lens-Free microscopy with applications in bacterial growth monitoring and deep learning-based bacterial detection</h3>
												    <p> Lens-based imaging systems are widely used in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics but often suffer from high cost, limited field of view (FOV), and the need for skilled operation. Lens-free microscopy (LM) offers a compelling alternative, enabling low-cost, compact, and scalable imaging systems using only a light source and an imaging sensor. However, the resolution of LM is fundamentally limited by sensor pixel size. To overcome this, pixel super-resolution techniques—particularly when paired with multi-angle illumination from LED arrays—can significantly enhance spatial resolution. We present OpenLM, an open-source lens-free microscopy platform integrated with a pixel super-resolution algorithm. The system comprises four low-cost, commercially available components: a Raspberry Pi camera, a filter, an LED array, and a Raspberry Pi board. The housing is 3D printed for ease of replication. We developed intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) applications for both Raspberry Pi OS and Windows OS to enable camera control, real-time preview, image acquisition, and processing—without requiring prior expertise in lens-free imaging. To demonstrate the utility of OpenLM, we applied it to two biological tasks: (1) long-term time-lapse imaging of Escherichia coli colony growth, where colonies become visible within 30 minutes and later-stage interactions can be observed thanks to the large FOV; and (2) early-stage bacterial detection using a YOLO(You Only Look Once)-based deep learning model. With its affordability, high resolution, large FOV, and user-friendly software, OpenLM is a versatile tool for research and education in resource-limited or distributed settings. </p>

												    <h3>Digital monitoring of the microchannel filling flow dynamics using a non-contactless smartphone-based nano-liter precision flow velocity meter</h3>
												    <p> Microfluidic systems find widespread applications in diagnostics, biological research, chemistry, and engineering studies. Among their many critical parameters, flow rate plays a pivotal role in maintaining the functionality of microfluidic systems, including droplet-based microfluidic devices and those used in cell culture. It also significantly influences microfluidic mixing processes. Although various flow rate measurement devices have been developed, the challenge remains in accurately measuring flow rates within customized channels. This paper presents the development of a 3D-printed smartphone-based flow velocity meter. The 3D-printed platform is angled at 30° to achieve transparent flow visualization, and it doesn't require any external optical components such as external lenses and filters. Two LED modules integrated into the platform create a uniform illumination environment for video capture, powered directly by the smartphone. The performance of our platform, combined with a customized video processing algorithm, was assessed in three different channel types: uniform straight channels, straight channels with varying widths, and vessel-like channel patterns to demonstrate its versatility. Our device effectively measured flow velocities from 5.43 mm/s to 24.47 mm/s, with video quality at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second, for which the measurement range can be extended by adjusting the frame rate. This flow velocity meter can be a useful analytical tool to evaluate and enhance microfluidic channel designs of various lab-on-a-chip applications. </p>
